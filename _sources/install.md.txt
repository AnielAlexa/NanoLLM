# Installation

The recommended installation method is by running the Docker container image built by [jetson-containers](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-containers).  First, clone that repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-containers
cd jetson-containers
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can start `nano_llm` container like this:

```bash
./run.sh $(./autotag nano_llm)
```

This will automatically pull/run the container image compatible with your version of JetPack-L4T (e.g. `dustynv/nano_llm:r36.2.0` for JetPack 6.0 DP)
