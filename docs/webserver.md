# Websockets

There is a extensible webserver implemented using Flask and websockets that allows agents to serve frontend HTML pages, along with bi-directional messaging using websockets, including custom message types specific to each application.

## Webserver API

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: nano_llm.web.WebServer
   :special-members: __init__
   :members:
```
